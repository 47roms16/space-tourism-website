# Space Tourism Website 🌌

![Design preview](./preview.jpg)

A frontend project built with React and TypeScript to explore destinations, crew, and technology data — Challenge by the space tourism website challenge from Frontend Mentor.

## Built with React and TypeScript

This project was built using React and TypeScript. I wrote the codes for layout, UI, and implemented the functionality based on the design and data provided by Frontend Mentor. The data (destinations, crew, and technology) and the design inspiration were given as part of the challenge, but the code and components were all created from scratch. I also added UI for /destination and /crew instead of empty page.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- React + TypeScript + React Router + React Three Fiber
- Data loading with `createBrowserRouter` and route loaders
- Dynamic routing (`/destinations/:planet`)
- Fully responsive layout
- Clean and modular component structure

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `pages/` — All main route views
- `components/` — Shared UI components
- `helpers/loader.ts` — Route data loader logic
- `constants/types.ts` — TypeScript types for data

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`
